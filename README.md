# Expert_Digital_Forensics_Report
This report is a project I completed at my college in May of 2024. It was requested of me that I forensically analyze and document a specific PDF file and determine if the given signature was real, or if the document showed likely signs of tampering.

# Disclaimers
My report does not include my "curriculum vitae" as stated in the "Background and Experience" section as the only purpose this assignment served was to perform forensic analysis. Much of the jargon listed before the images in my report was a formality. And I obviously was not actually employed by the state of Virginia to solve this problem, it was simply a requirement of my teacher as he was showing his students what a real document may look like.
